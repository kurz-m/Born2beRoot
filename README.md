## Instructions
Please make sure to get a solid understanding of what you are doing and critically check if you are going through my instruction file.
Also try to create functions or lines of code with your own style of programming to feel comfortable explaining them.
My Instructions are written with being logged in as the root user. If you are using another user, you have to use the `sudo` command for most of the commands.
Also, get to know the system and test each feature to deepen your knowledge. Furthermore, prepare yourself for the evaluations by playing around
with creating users, changing passwords, typing in wrong passwords, creating groups, etc. This helps to get through the evaluations because
for _Born2beRoot_ they are quite long and therefore you should make sure to know your stuff.

If you tried your best and you need some help with _Born2beRoot_ then you can have a look at [my instructions](./Guide/Instructions.md).
They are not an exhaustive document but give instructions about how you can setup the system. Other commands you have to search for yourself.

## Script
[Here](./Guide/monitoring.sh) is the link to the script I wrote for the _Born2beRoot_ project of 42 Heilbronn.
Double check if it is running on your system and adjust to your own style of programming. There are always several ways to achieve
the same goal.

## Other
I am always open to get some hints for improvements or minor mistakes. Thanks!
