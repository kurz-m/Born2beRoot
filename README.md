## Instructions
Please make sure to get a solid understanding of what you are doing and critically check if you are going through my instruction file.
Also try to create functions or lines of code with your own style of programming to feel comfortable explaining them.
My Instructions are written with being logged in as the root user. If you are using another user, you have to use the `sudo` command for most of the commands.
Also, get to know the system and test each feature to deepen your knowledge.

If you tried your best and you need some help with _Born2beRoot_ then you can have a look at [my instructions](./Instructions.md).

## Script
[Here](./monitoring.sh) is the link to the script I wrote for the _Born2beRoot_ project of 42 Heilbronn.

## Other
I am always open to get some hints for improvements or minor mistakes. Thanks!
